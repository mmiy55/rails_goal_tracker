# ðŸ“š Think-Peaks, your Goal Tracker

Think-Peaks is a app I built to keep track of personal goals in different areas.

## Acknowledgements
Inspired by a Hackathon challenge I found at https://troopl.com/challenges/goal-tracking-app.
The app satisfy the challenge requisites which are :

"Use any language/framework to build a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app that lets people:

>Create an account




>Add a goal 
>Update a goal as complete (i.e. a percentage or true/false) 
>Visualise complete and incomplete goals 
>Delete a goal"
